## Me

Hiya, I'm Steyn de Klerk.
I am a full-stack developer.

Yes I got a Danish domain because of my surname.
I have been going by `Steyndk` and `Staindk` online for most of my life, so this domain was perfect.

I have some plans for this site - hopefully I can showcase some personal projects and rant about what annoys me in games.

You can email [me@steyn.dk](mailto:me@steyn.dk) or visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/Staindk).

## Site

My site's styling is an alteration of the stock [Poole](https://getpoole.com/) "butler" for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for free.
The repo is available [here](https://github.com/Staindk/staindk.github.io).
