## Me

Hiya, I'm Steyn de Klerk. Yes my surname is why I bought a Danish domain - I just felt it was perfect.

I've got some plans for this site - hopefully I can showcase some personal projects and rant about what annoys me in games.

You can email [me@steyn.dk](mailto:me@steyn.dk) or visit my (currently pretty sparse & private) [GitHub](https://github.com/Staindk).

## About Site

My site's styling is an alteration of the stock [Poole](https://getpoole.com/) butler/template for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for free. The repo is available [here](https://github.com/Staindk/staindk.github.io).
