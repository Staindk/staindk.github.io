Hi! 

Site is currently a WIP, but please have a look at some of the amazing (ðŸ˜‚) pages that are available to you right now:

[About](/about)

[Archive](/archive)

[Ooh what's this?](/404)

## Plans for the nearish future

1. Improve website -
    * Revise CSS and other styling
    * Menu bar for About/Archive/Projects/etc. links?
    * Other improvements
2. Go over a private project to ensure no API/auth keys have been committed, then make it public
3. Clean up and post some of my 3D (-printable) designs to [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/), and cross-link them here
4. Design some more 3D doohickeys for my car and coffee machine and upload to Thingiverse
